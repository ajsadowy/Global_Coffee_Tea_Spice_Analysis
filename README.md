# Global Coffee, Tea, and other Spices Analysis   
"He who controls the spice controls the universe."
A great line from a great Sci-Fi classic Dune, our world is run on spice. Not necessarily the galatic fuel for space travel, but the type that gives us additional flavors to our culinary tastes as wells as providers of unique organic molecules used for health and personal energy benefits. The goods are consistantly traded around the world and with consistant demand it seems like an interesting topic for further statistical analysis.   

## Project Overview   
The purpose of this project is to explore global import and export data of common coffee, tea, and other spices/herbs. We choose this topic because these trade goods are a staple to our modern world.    

### Process   

#### Data Collection   
We gather data from [UN Data website](http://data.un.org/Default.aspx), a great repository for data files on global topics. Specifically [here]( http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=ComTrade&f=_l1Code%3a10), we were able to download the csv files on the topic of global trade on coffee, tea, mate, and spices.   

On this site we came across our first obstacle, the site had a limitation of how large the csv file can be downloaded. Luckily the site allows for filtering the data based on topics like trade goods, country of origins, and year. We were able to get the complete data by downloading seperate csv files based on trade goods. With this we had workable csv files.

### Team Communication
* Slack - Most direct form of communication when working.   
* Zoom  - Biweekly meetings to see where everyone is with the project.   
* Group Text Group - Direct communication when away from project.   
* Discord - Back up communication if Zoom were to fail.
